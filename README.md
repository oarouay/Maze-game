#Labyrinth Generator and Visualizer
##Overview
This Python project creates and visualizes a random labyrinth using a graph-based representation. It generates a solvable labyrinth and highlights the solution path using BFS.

##Features
Graph Representation: Nodes (cells) and edges (walls) with open/closed states.
Random Labyrinth Generation: Ensures a solvable maze between a start and goal.
Pathfinding: Implements BFS and DFS to find and visualize paths.
Visualization: Uses Turtle Graphics to display the labyrinth and the solution.
##How to Run
Install Python.
Run the script in an environment with the turtle module.
The maze and solution will be displayed in a Turtle Graphics window.
##Requirements
Python 3.x
turtle module
Customization
Modify l and c to change the labyrinth's size.

Enjoy solving your randomly generated labyrinth!
